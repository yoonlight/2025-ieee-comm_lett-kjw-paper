  abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular systems will enable gigabit-per-second data rates thanks to the large bandwidth available at mmWave frequencies. To realize sufficient link margin, mmWave systems will employ directional beamforming with large antenna arrays at both the transmitter and receiver. Due to the high cost and power consumption of gigasample mixed-signal devices, mmWave precoding will likely be divided among the analog and digital domains. The large number of antennas and the presence of analog beamforming requires the development of mmWave-specific channel estimation and precoding algorithms. This paper develops an adaptive algorithm to estimate the mmWave channel parameters that exploits the poor scattering nature of the channel. To enable the efficient operation of this algorithm, a novel hierarchical multi-resolution codebook is designed to construct training beamforming vectors with different beamwidths. For single-path channels, an upper bound on the estimation error probability using the proposed algorithm is derived, and some insights into the efficient allocation of the training power among the adaptive stages of the algorithm are obtained. The adaptive channel estimation algorithm is then extended to the multi-path case relying on the sparse nature of the channel. Using the estimated channel, this paper proposes a new hybrid analog/digital precoding algorithm that overcomes the hardware constraints on the analog-only beamforming, and approaches the performance of digital solutions. Simulation results show that the proposed low-complexity channel estimation algorithm achieves comparable precoding gains compared to exhaustive channel training algorithms. The results illustrate that the proposed channel estimation and precoding algorithms can approach the coverage probability achieved by perfect channel knowledge even in the presence of interference.},

  abstract = {Channel estimation is a critical task in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) digital communications that substantially affects end-to-end system performance. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for channel estimation using deep score-based generative models. A model is trained to estimate the gradient of the logarithm of a distribution and is used to iteratively refine estimates given measurements of a signal. We introduce a framework for training score-based generative models for wireless MIMO channels and performing channel estimation based on posterior sampling at test time. We derive theoretical robustness guarantees for channel estimation with posterior sampling in single-input single-output scenarios, and experimentally verify performance in the MIMO setting. Our results in simulated channels show competitive in-distribution performance, and robust out-of-distribution performance, with gains of up to 5 dB in end-to-end coded communication performance compared to supervised deep learning methods. Simulations on the number of pilots show that high fidelity channel estimation with 25\% pilot density is possible for MIMO channel sizes of up to 64 \textbackslash times 256 . Complexity analysis reveals that model size can efficiently trade performance for estimation latency, and that the proposed approach is competitive with compressed sensing in terms of floating-point operation (FLOP) count.},

  abstract = {Reliable coherent wireless communication requires accurate estimation of the time-varying multipath channel. This paper addresses two issues in the context of direct-sequence code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems: (i) linear minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) channel estimation based on a pilot transmission and (ii) impact of channel estimation errors on coherent receiver performance. A simple characterization of the MMSE estimator in terms of a bank of filters is derived. A key channel characteristic controlling system performance is the normalized coherence time, which is approximately the number of symbols over which the channel remains strongly correlated. It is shown that the estimator performance is characterized by an effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-the product of the pilot SNR and the normalized coherence time. A simple uniform averaging estimator is also proposed that is easy to implement and delivers near-optimal performance if properly designed. The receivers analyzed in this paper are based on a time-frequency RAKE structure that exploits joint multipath-Doppler diversity. It is shown that the overall receiver performance is controlled by two competing effects: shorter coherence times lead to degraded channel estimation but improved inherent receiver performance due to Doppler diversity, with opposite effects for longer coherence times. Our results demonstrate that exploiting Doppler diversity can significantly mitigate the error probability floors that plague conventional CDMA receivers under fast fading due to errors in channel estimation.},

Virtually all existing statistical models for wireless channels are implicitly based on the assumption of rich multipath, which can be traced back to the seminal works of Bello and Kennedy on the wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering model, and more recently to the i.i.d. model for multi-antenna channels proposed by Telatar, and Foschini Gans. However, physical arguments and growing experimental evidence suggest that physical channels encountered in practice exhibit a sparse multipath structure that gets more pronounced as the signal space dimension gets large (e.g., due to large bandwidth or large number of antennas). In this paper, we formalize the notion of multipath sparsity and discuss applications of the emerging theory of compressed sensing for efficient estimation of sparse multipath channels.},

We first compute the mean square error (MSE) of the LS channel estimate. We then derive optimal pilot sequences and optimal placement of the pilot tones with respect to this MSE. It is shown that the optimal pilot sequences are equipowered, equispaced, and phase shift orthogonal. To reduce the training overhead, an LS channel estimation scheme over multiple OFDM symbols is also discussed. Moreover, to enhance channel estimation, a recursive LS (RLS) algorithm is proposed, for which we derive the optimal forgetting or tracking factor. This factor is found to be a function of both the noise variance and the channel Doppler spread. Through simulations, it is shown that the optimal pilot sequences derived in this paper outperform both the orthogonal and random pilot sequences. It is also shown that a considerable gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be obtained by using the RLS algorithm, especially in slowly time-varying channels.},

Recently, diffusion models are repurposed for solving inverse problems using Gaussian approximations to conditional densities of the reverse process via Tweedie’s formula to parameterise the mean, complemented with various heuristics. To address various challenges arising from these approximations, we leverage higher order information using Tweedie’s formula and obtain a statistically principled approximation. We further provide a theoretical guarantee specifically for posterior sampling which can lead to better theoretical understanding of diffusion-based conditional sampling. Finally, we illustrate the empirical effectiveness of our approach for general linear inverse problems on toy synthetic examples as well as image restoration. We show that our method (i) removes any time-dependent step-size hyperparameters required by earlier methods, (ii) brings stability and better sample quality across multiple noise levels, (iii) is the only method that works in a stable way with variance exploding (VE) forward processes as opposed to earlier works.},

  abstract = {Millimeter-wave wireless systems are emerging as a promising technology for meeting the exploding capacity requirements of wireless communication networks. Besides large bandwidths, small wavelengths at mm-wave lead to a high-dimensional spatial signal space, that can be exploited for significant capacity gains through high-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques. In conventional MIMO approaches, optimal performance requires prohibitively high transceiver complexity. By combining the concept of beamspace MIMO communication with a hybrid analog-digital transceiver, continuous aperture phased (CAP) MIMO achieves near-optimal performance with dramatically lower complexity. This paper presents a framework for physically-accurate computational modeling and analysis of CAP-MIMO, and reports measurement results on a DLA-based prototype for multimode line-of-sight communication. The model, based on a critically sampled system representation, is used to demonstrate the performance gains of CAP-MIMO over state-of-the-art designs at mm-wave. For example, a CAP-MIMO system can achieve a spectral efficiency of 10–20 bits/s/Hz with a 17–31 dB power advantage over state-of-the-art, corresponding to a data rate of 10–200 Gbps with 1–10 GHz system bandwidth. The model is refined to analyze critical sources of power loss in an actual multimode system. The prototype-based measurement results closely follow the theoretical predictions, validating CAP-MIMO theory, and illustrating the utility of the model.},

In the first stage, the pilot itself and the channel estimator are jointly designed by using both a two-layer neural network (TNN) and a deep neural network (DNN). In the second stage, the accuracy of channel estimation is further enhanced by using another DNN in an iterative manner. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation scheme has much better performance than the conventional channel estimation scheme.

However, most works focus on solving simple linear inverse problems in noiseless settings, which significantly under-represents the complexity of real-world problems. In this work, we extend diffusion solvers to efficiently handle general noisy (non)linear inverse problems via the Laplace approximation of the posterior sampling. Interestingly, the resulting posterior sampling scheme is a blended version of diffusion sampling with the manifold constrained gradient without a strict measurement consistency projection step, yielding a more desirable generative path in noisy settings compared to the previous studies. Our method demonstrates that diffusion models can incorporate various measurement noise statistics such as Gaussian and Poisson, and also efficiently handle noisy nonlinear inverse problems such as Fourier phase retrieval and non-uniform deblurring.},

A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) with positional embedding of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) information is designed to learn the channel distribution in the sparse angular domain. Combined with an estimation strategy that avoids stochastic resampling and truncates reverse diffusion steps that account for lower SNR than the given pilot observation, the resulting DM estimator unifies low complexity and memory overhead. Numerical results exhibit better performance than state-of-the-art estimators.},

  abstract = {Multiple-antenna wireless communication links promise very high data rates with low error probabilities, especially when the wireless channel response is known at the receiver. In practice, knowledge of the channel is often obtained by sending known training symbols to the receiver. We show how training affects the capacity of a fading channel-too little training and the channel is improperly learned, too much training and there is no time left for data transmission before the channel changes. We compute a lower bound on the capacity of a channel that is learned by training, and maximize the bound as a function of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), fading coherence time, and number of transmitter antennas. When the training and data powers are allowed to vary, we show that the optimal number of training symbols is equal to the number of transmit antennas-this number is also the smallest training interval length that guarantees meaningful estimates of the channel matrix. When the training and data powers are instead required to be equal, the optimal number of symbols may be larger than the number of antennas. We show that training-based schemes can be optimal at high SNR, but suboptimal at low SNR.},

  abstract = {One of the fundamental challenges to realize massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications is the accurate acquisition of channel state information for a plurality of users at the base station. This is usually accomplished in the UpLink (UL) direction profiting from the time division duplexing mode. In practical base station transceivers, there exist inevitably nonlinear hardware components, like signal amplifiers and various analog filters, which complicates the calibration task. To deal with this challenge, we design a deep neural network for channel calibration between the UL and DownLink (DL) directions. During the initial training phase, the deep neural network is trained from both UL and DL channel measurements. We then leverage the trained deep neural network with the instantaneously estimated UL channel to calibrate the DL one, which is not observable during the UL transmission phase. Our numerical results confirm the merits of the proposed approach, and show that it can achieve performance comparable to conventional approaches, like the Agros method and methods based on least squares, that however assume linear hardware behavior models. More importantly, considering generic nonlinear relationships between the UL and DL channels, it is demonstrated that our deep neural network approach exhibits robust performance, even when the number of training sequences is limited.},

By leveraging the advantage of sparseness, we propose an algorithm that iteratively detects the exact locations and values of nonzero entries of the sparse channel matrix. At each iteration, the locations are detected by the SMP, and values are estimated with the LSE. We also analyze the Cramér–Rao Lower Bound (CLRB), and show that the proposed algorithm is a minimum variance unbiased estimator under the assumption that we have the partial priori knowledge of the channel. Furthermore, we employ the Gaussian approximation for message densities under density evolution to simplify the analysis of the algorithm, which provides a simple method to predict the performance of the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm has much better performance than the existing sparse estimators, especially when the channel is sparse. In addition, our proposed algorithm converges to the CRLB of the genie-aided estimation of sparse channels with only five turbo iterations.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has emerged as an effective tool for channel estimation in wireless communication systems, especially under some imperfect environments. However, even with such unprecedented success, DL methods are often regarded as black boxes and are lack of explanations on their internal mechanisms, which severely limits their further improvement and extension. In this paper, we present preliminary theoretical analysis on DL based channel estimation for single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems to understand and interpret its internal mechanisms. As deep neural network (DNN) with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function is mathematically equivalent to a piecewise linear function, the corresponding DL estimator can achieve universal approximation to a large family of functions by making efficient use of piecewise linearity. We demonstrate that DL based channel estimation does not restrict to any specific signal model and asymptotically approaches to the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation in various scenarios without requiring any prior knowledge of channel statistics. Therefore, DL based channel estimation outperforms or is at least comparable with traditional channel estimation, depending on the types of channels. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the proposed interpretation and demonstrate the effectiveness of DL based channel estimation under both linear and nonlinear signal models.},

Since DL principles are inductive in nature and distinct from the conventional rule-based algorithms, when one tries to use DL technique to the channel estimation, one might easily get stuck and confused by so many knobs to control and small details to be aware of. The primary purpose of this paper is to discuss key issues and possible solutions in DL-based wireless channel estimation and channel state information (CSI) feedback including the DL model selection, training data acquisition, and neural network design for 6G.

Each receiver antenna of the base station is assumed to be equipped with a pair of one-bit analog-to-digital converters to quantize the real and imaginary part of the received signal. We first propose an approach for channel estimation that is applicable for both flat and frequency-selective fading, based on the Bussgang decomposition that reformulates the nonlinear quantizer as a linear function with identical first- and second-order statistics. The resulting channel estimator outperforms previously proposed approaches across all SNRs. We then derive closed-form expressions for the achievable rate in flat fading channels assuming low SNR and a large number of users for the maximal ratio and zero forcing receivers that takes channel estimation error due to both noise and one-bit quantization into account. The closed-form expressions, in turn, allow us to obtain insight into important system design issues such as optimal resource allocation, maximal sum spectral efficiency, overall energy efficiency, and number of antennas. Numerical results are presented to verify our analytical results and demonstrate the benefit of optimizing system performance accordingly.},

We show that there are two types of interference components in this scheme that do not vanish even when the number of antennas grows to infinity. The first type, referred to as cross-contamination, is due to the correlation among the data signals from different users. The second type, referred to as self-contamination, is due to the dependency between the channel estimate and the estimation error. Cross contamination is in principle similar to pilot contamination in a conventional pilot-based channel estimation scheme, while self-contamination is unique for the data-aided scheme. For efficient use of the channel, the data part in a signaling frame is typically much longer than the pilot part for a practical system. Consequently, compared with pilot signals, data signals naturally have lower cross correlation. This fact reduces the cross-contamination effect in the data-aided scheme. Furthermore, self-contamination can be effectively suppressed by iterative processing. These results are confirmed by both analyses and simulations.},

Relying on a basis expansion channel model, we design low-complexity optimal PSAM for block transmissions over doubly selective channels. The optimality in designing our PSAM parameters consists of maximizing a tight lower bound on the average channel capacity that is shown to be equivalent to the minimization of the minimum mean-square channel estimation error.

This is motivated by the possible reduction in the number of RF chains and analog-to-digital converters. In these architectures, the analog processing network is usually based on variable phase shifters. In this paper, we propose hybrid architectures based on switching networks to reduce the complexity and the power consumption of the structures based on phase shifters. We define a power consumption model and use it to evaluate the energy efficiency of both structures. To estimate the complete MIMO channel, we propose an open-loop compressive channel estimation technique that is independent of the hardware used in the analog processing stage. We analyze the performance of the new estimation algorithm for hybrid architectures based on phase shifters and switches. Using the estimate, we develop two algorithms for the design of the hybrid combiner based on switches and analyze the achieved spectral efficiency. Finally, we study the tradeoffs between power consumption, hardware complexity, and spectral efficiency for hybrid architectures based on phase shifting networks and switching networks. Numerical results show that architectures based on switches obtain equal or better channel estimation performance to that obtained using phase shifters, while reducing hardware complexity and power consumption. For equal power consumption, all the hybrid architectures provide similar spectral efficiencies.},

We formulate the estimation problem as a noisy quantized compressed-sensing problem and solve it using efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms. In particular, we model the angle-delay coefficients using a Bernoulli-Gaussian-mixture distribution with unknown parameters and use the expectation-maximization forms of the generalized AMP and vector AMP algorithms to simultaneously learn the distributional parameters and compute approximately minimum mean-squared error (MSE) estimates of the channel coefficients. We design a training sequence that allows fast, fast Fourier transform based implementation of these algorithms while minimizing peak-to-average power ratio at the transmitter, making our methods scale efficiently to large numbers of antenna elements and delays. We present the results of a detailed simulation study that compares our algorithms to several benchmarks. Our study investigates the effect of SNR, training length, training type, ADC resolution, and runtime on channel estimation MSE, mutual information, and achievable rate. It shows that, in a mmWave MIMO system, the methods we propose to exploit joint angle-delay sparsity allow 1-bit ADCs to perform comparably to infinite-bit ADCs at low SNR, and 4-bit ADCs to perform comparably to infinite-bit ADCs at medium SNR.},

In this paper, we reveal that recent methods can be uniformly interpreted as employing a Gaussian approximation with hand-crafted isotropic covariance for the intractable denoising posterior to approximate the conditional posterior mean. Inspired by this finding, we propose to improve recent methods by using more principled covariance determined by maximum likelihood estimation. To achieve posterior covariance optimization without retraining, we provide general plug-and-play solutions based on two approaches specifically designed for leveraging pre-trained models with and without reverse covariance. We further propose a scalable method for learning posterior covariance prediction based on representation with orthonormal basis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly enhance reconstruction performance without requiring hyperparameter tuning.},

Although such linear mixing estimation problems are generally highly non-convex, Gaussian approximations of belief propagation (BP) have proven to be computationally attractive and highly effective in a range of applications. Recently, Bayati and Montanari have provided a rigorous and extremely general analysis of a large class of approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms that includes many Gaussian approximate BP methods. This paper extends their analysis to a larger class of algorithms to include what we call generalized AMP (G-AMP). G-AMP incorporates general (possibly non-AWGN) measurement channels. Similar to the AWGN output channel case, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the G-AMP algorithm under large i.i.d. Gaussian transform matrices is described by a simple set of state evolution (SE) equations. The general SE equations recover and extend several earlier results, including SE equations for approximate BP on general output channels by Guo and Wang.},

This paper surveys measurements and capacity studies to assess this technology with a focus on small cell deployments in urban environments. The conclusions are extremely encouraging; measurements in New York City at 28 and 73 GHz demonstrate that, even in an urban canyon environment, significant non-line-of-sight (NLOS) outdoor, street-level coverage is possible up to approximately 200 m from a potential low-power microcell or picocell base station. In addition, based on statistical channel models from these measurements, it is shown that mmW systems can offer more than an order of magnitude increase in capacity over current state-of-the-art 4G cellular networks at current cell densities. Cellular systems, however, will need to be significantly redesigned to fully achieve these gains. Specifically, the requirement of highly directional and adaptive transmissions, directional isolation between links, and significant possibilities of outage have strong implications on multiple access, channel structure, synchronization, and receiver design. To address these challenges, the paper discusses how various technologies including adaptive beamforming, multihop relaying, heterogeneous network architectures, and carrier aggregation can be leveraged in the mmW context.},

The approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm proposed by Donoho, Maleki, and Montanari is a computationally efficient iterative approach to SLR that has a remarkable property: for large i.i.d. sub-Gaussian matrices A, its per-iteration behavior is rigorously characterized by a scalar state-evolution whose fixed points, when unique, are Bayes optimal. The AMP algorithm, however, is fragile in that even small deviations from the i.i.d. sub-Gaussian model can cause the algorithm to diverge. This paper considers a “vector AMP” (VAMP) algorithm and shows that VAMP has a rigorous scalar state-evolution that holds under a much broader class of large random matrices A: those that are right-orthogonally invariant. After performing an initial singular value decomposition (SVD) of A, the per-iteration complexity of VAMP is similar to that of AMP. In addition, the fixed points of VAMP's state evolution are consistent with the replica prediction of the minimum mean-squared error derived by Tulino, Caire, Verdú, and Shamai. Numerical experiments are used to confirm the effectiveness of VAMP and its consistency with state-evolution predictions.},

These frequencies also offer the potential for revolutionary applications that will be made possible by new thinking, and advances in devices, circuits, software, signal processing, and systems. This paper describes many of the technical challenges and opportunities for wireless communication and sensing applications above 100 GHz, and presents a number of promising discoveries, novel approaches, and recent results that will aid in the development and implementation of the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks, and beyond. This paper shows recent regulatory and standard body rulings that are anticipating wireless products and services above 100 GHz and illustrates the viability of wireless cognition, hyper-accurate position location, sensing, and imaging. This paper also presents approaches and results that show how long distance mobile communications will be supported to above 800 GHz since the antenna gains are able to overcome air-induced attenuation, and present methods that reduce the computational complexity and simplify the signal processing used in adaptive antenna arrays, by exploiting the Special Theory of Relativity to create a cone of silence in over-sampled antenna arrays that improve performance for digital phased array antennas. Also, new results that give insights into power efficient beam steering algorithms, and new propagation and partition loss models above 100 GHz are given, and promising imaging, array processing, and position location results are presented. The implementation of spatial consistency at THz frequencies, an important component of channel modeling that considers minute changes and correlations over space, is also discussed.

Existing methods often rely on Tweedie's first-order moments that tend to induce biased results [32]. Second-order approximations are computationally prohibitive, making standard reverse diffusion processes in-tractable for posterior sampling. We present Second-order Tweedie sampler from Surrogate Loss (STSL), a novel sampler offering efficiency comparable to first-order Tweedie while enabling tractable reverse processes using second-order approximation. Theoretical results reveal that our approach establishes a lower bound through a surrogate loss and enables a tractable reverse process using the trace of the Hessian with only \textbackslash mathcalO(1) compute. We show STSL out-performs SoTA solvers PSLD [43] and P2L [10] by reducing neural function evaluations by 4X and 8X, respectively, while enhancing sampling quality on FFHQ, ImageNet, and COCO benchmarks. Moreover, STSL extends to text-guided image editing, effectively mitigating residual distortions in corrupted images. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to offer an efficient second-order approximation for solving inverse problems using latent diffusion, which further enables editing real-world images with corruptions.},

Current approaches represent two extremes: idealized statistical models representing a rich scattering environment and parameterized physical models that describe realistic scattering environments via the angles and gains associated with different propagation paths. However, simple rules that capture the effects of scattering characteristics on channel capacity and diversity are difficult to infer from existing models. We propose an intermediate virtual channel representation that captures the essence of physical modeling and provides a simple geometric interpretation of the scattering environment. The virtual representation corresponds to a fixed coordinate transformation via spatial basis functions defined by fixed virtual angles. We show that in an uncorrelated scattering environment, the elements of the channel matrix form a segment of a stationary process and that the virtual channel coefficients are approximately uncorrelated samples of the underlying spectral representation. For any scattering environment, the virtual channel matrix clearly reveals the two key factors affecting capacity: the number of parallel channels and the level of diversity. The concepts of spatial zooming and aliasing are introduced to provide a transparent interpretation of the effect of antenna spacing on channel statistics and capacity. Numerical results are presented to illustrate various aspects of the virtual framework.},

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone.

In practice, however, the distribution is unknown, motivating the use of robust algorithms like LASSO-which is nearly minimax optimal-at the cost of significantly larger MSE for non-least-favorable distributions. As an alternative, we propose an empirical-Bayesian technique that simultaneously learns the signal distribution while MMSE-recovering the signal-according to the learned distribution-using AMP. In particular, we model the non-zero distribution as a Gaussian mixture and learn its parameters through expectation maximization, using AMP to implement the expectation step.

Specifically, we have shown that SBL retains a desirable property of the /spl lscr//sub 0/-norm diversity measure (i.e., the global minimum is achieved at the maximally sparse solution) while often possessing a more limited constellation of local minima. We have also demonstrated that the local minima that do exist are achieved at sparse solutions. Later, we provide a novel interpretation of SBL that gives us valuable insight into why it is successful in producing sparse representations. Finally, we include simulation studies comparing sparse Bayesian learning with basis pursuit and the more recent FOCal Underdetermined System Solver (FOCUSS) class of basis selection algorithms. These results indicate that our theoretical insights translate directly into improved performance.},

  abstract = {Along with the prosperity of generative artificial intelligence (AI), its potential for solving conventional challenges in wireless communications has also surfaced. Inspired by this trend, we investigate the application of the advanced diffusion models (DMs), a representative class of generative AI models, to high dimensional wireless channel estimation. By capturing the structure of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels via a deep generative prior encoded by DMs, we develop a novel posterior inference method for channel reconstruction. We further adapt the proposed method to recover channel information from low-resolution quantized measurements. Additionally, to enhance the over-the-air viability, we integrate the DM with the unsupervised Stein’s unbiased risk estimator to enable learning from noisy observations and circumvent the requirements for ground truth channel data that is hardly available in practice. Results reveal that the proposed estimator achieves high-fidelity channel recovery while reducing estimation latency by a factor of 10 compared to state-of-the-art schemes, facilitating real-time implementation. Moreover, our method outperforms existing estimators while reducing the pilot overhead by half, showcasing its scalability to ultra-massive antenna arrays.},

  abstract = {We suppose that the statistician observes some large number of estimates zi, each with its own unobserved expectation parameter {$\mu$}i. The largest few of the zi's are likely to substantially overestimate their corresponding {$\mu$}i's, this being an example of selection bias, or regression to the mean. Tweedie's formula, first reported by Robbins in 1956, offers a simple empirical Bayes approach for correcting selection bias. This article investigates its merits and limitations. In addition to the methodology, Tweedie's formula raises more general questions concerning empirical Bayes theory, discussed here as "relevance" and "empirical Bayes information." There is a close connection between applications of the formula and James---Stein estimation.},

  abstract = {The generalized minimum residual method (GMRES) is well known for solving large nonsymmetric systems of linear equations. It generally uses restarting, which slows the convergence. However, some information can be retained at the time of the restart and used in the next cycle. We present algorithms that use implicit restarting in order to retain this information. Approximate eigenvectors determined from the previous subspace are included in the new subspace. This deflates the smallest eigenvalues and thus improves the convergence. The subspace that contains the approximate eigenvectors is itself a Krylov subspace, but not with the usual starting vector. The implicitly restarted FOM algorithm includes standard Ritz vectors in the subspace. The eigenvalue portion of its calculations is equivalent to Sorensen's IRA algorithm. The implicitly restarted GMRES algorithm uses harmonic Ritz vectors. This algorithm also gives a new approach to computing interior eigenvalues.},

  abstract = {We consider joint channel estimation and faulty antenna detection for massive multiple-input multiple-output systems operating in time-division duplexing mode. For systems with faulty antennas, we show that the impact of faulty antennas on uplink data transmission does not vanish even with unlimited number of antennas. However, the signal detection performance can be improved with a priori knowledge on the indices of faulty antennas. This motivates us to propose the approach for simultaneous channel estimation and faulty antenna detection. By exploiting the fact that the degrees of freedom of the physical channel matrix are smaller than the number of free parameters, the channel estimation and faulty antenna detection can be formulated as an extended atomic norm denoising problem and solved efficiently via the alternating direction method of multipliers. Furthermore, we improve the computational efficiency by proposing a fast algorithm and show that it is a good approximation of the corresponding extended atomic norm minimization method. Numerical simulations are provided to compare the performances of the proposed algorithms with several existing approaches and demonstrate the performance gains of detecting the indices of faulty antennas.},

This neural network can learn channel structure and estimate channel from a large number of training data. Furthermore, we provide an analytical framework on the asymptotic performance of the channel estimator. Based on our analysis and simulation results, the LDAMP neural network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compressed sensing-based algorithms even when the receiver is equipped with a small number of RF chains.},
