\section{Introduction}

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) has been a key technology of modern wireless communication systems, which can provide high data rates and high spectral efficiency thanks to the large number of antenna arrays and high carrier frequencies. Acquisition of channel state information by channel estimation must be performed to achieve these gains. Traditional channel estimation approaches such as least squares (LS) and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) have suffered from degraded performance and the increased number of pilot symbols due to the high dimensionality from the large number of antennas, leading to reduction in spectral efficiency~\cite{hassibiHowMuchTraining2003}. To address this problem, compressed sensing (CS) based approaches have been proposed to reduce the pilot overhead by leveraging the inherent sparsity of mmWave channels, but the performance relies on accurate sparsity and channel modeling~\cite{zhangAtomicNormDenoisingBased2018,mendez-rialHybridMIMOArchitectures2016,choiCompressedSensingWireless2017}.

These limitations have motivated the research on deep learning (DL) based channel estimation, which has been confirmed to have better approximation capability compared to mathematical modeling~\cite{kimDeepLearningaidedWireless2023, heDeepLearningBasedChannel2018}. In particular, diffusion models, one of the generative models, have gained much attention for their ability to approximate the complex distribution of data~\cite{arvinteMIMOChannelEstimation2023,feslDiffusionBasedGenerativePrior2024,zhouGenerativeDiffusionModels2025}. As shown in~\cite{arvinteMIMOChannelEstimation2023}, a posterior sampling method for channel estimation based on DM has been introduced. This method has been confirmed to outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of estimation accuracy. However, the large number of sampling steps is required to achieve this performance. To address this limitation, denoising strategy for DM-based channel estimator has been proposed, leveraging the LS estimate, as shown in~\cite{feslDiffusionBasedGenerativePrior2024}. This strategy has been confirmed to reduce the sampling latency of the estimator, but at the cost of increased pilot overhead. In~\cite{zhouGenerativeDiffusionModels2025}, the novel DM-based estimator has been proposed, considering the pilot overhead and achieving better estimation latency compared to~\cite{arvinteMIMOChannelEstimation2023} in the line-of-sight (LOS) environment. However, in the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environment, the validation of the performance has been limited to full pilot overhead.

In this letter, a novel channel estimator based on diffusion posterior sampling is proposed to jointly address the pilot overhead and latency in both LOS and NLOS environments. First, the diffusion posterior sampling is decomposed into a prior from trained diffusion model and posterior guidance term. Subsequently, posterior guidance term is derived in the form of Jacobian-vector product (JVP) by leveraging Tweedieâ€™s formula and a moment matching method. Finally, the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) is employed to approximate the JVP, thereby avoiding the high complexity of direct matrix inversion. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional compressed sensing approaches and other diffusion model-based estimators in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) across both LOS and NLOS environments. Furthermore, a latency comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) DM-based estimators is achieved while all counterparts are outperformed in terms of neural function evaluation (NFE).

\section{System Model}

In this letter, mmWave massive MIMO downlink channel is considered. To simplify, uniform linear array with half wavelength and a quasi-static channel is assumed. Received pilot symbol is expressed as, 

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{H}\mathbf{P}+\mathbf{N}\in \mathbb{C}^{N_{r}\times N_{p}}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{H}\in \mathbb{C}^{N_{r}\times N_{t}}$ is channel matrix, $\mathbf{P}\in \mathbb{C}^{N_{t}\times N_{p}}$ is known pilot symbol, and $\mathbf{N}\sim\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\sigma^{2}\mathbf{I})$ is additive white Gaussian noise. Under the assumption of ULA and channel matrix can be expressed as virtual channel representation as 

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{A}_{R}\mathbf{H}_{V}\mathbf{A}_{T}^{H},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{A}_{R}$ and $\mathbf{A}_{T}$ are DFT matrices and $\mathbf{H}_{V}$ is channel matrix of angular domain. Vectorized form of received symbol is expressed as,

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{h}+\mathbf{n}\in \mathbb{C}^{N_{r}N_{p}\times 1},
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{y}$, $\mathbf{h}_{V}$, $\mathbf{n}$ are vector form of received symbol, channel matrix of angular domain, and noise each. $\mathbf{A}=(\mathbf{P}^{\top}\otimes\mathbf{I}_{N_{r}})((\mathbf{A}_{T}^{H})^{\top}\otimes \mathbf{A}_{R})\in \mathbb{C}^{N_{r}N_{p}\times N_{r}N_{t}}$ is vectorized by Kronecker product.

\section{Proposed Method}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_{t} = \sqrt{ \bar{\alpha}_{t} }\mathbf{h}_{0} + \sqrt{ 1-\bar{\alpha}_{t} }\epsilon_{t},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}[\|\epsilon_{t} - \epsilon_{\theta}(\mathbf{h}_{t},t)\|_{2}^{2}],
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_{t-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ \alpha_{t} }}(\mathbf{h}_{t}+(1-\alpha_{t})\nabla_{\mathbf{h}_{t}}\log p_{t}(\mathbf{h}_{t}|\mathbf{y})),
\end{equation}
where $\nabla_{\mathbf{h}_{t}}\log p_{t}(\mathbf{h}_{t}|\mathbf{y})$ is posterior score decomposed by Bayes' rule as,

\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mathbf{h}_{t}}\log p_{t}(\mathbf{h}_{t}|\mathbf{y}) = \nabla_{\mathbf{h}_{t}}\log p_{t}(\mathbf{h}_{t})+\nabla_{\mathbf{h}_{t}}\log p_{t}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{h}_{t}),
\end{equation}

Prior score can be approximated by trained denoising networks expressed as,
\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mathbf{h}_{t}}\log p_{t}(\mathbf{h}_{t})\approx -\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 1-\bar{\alpha}_{t} }}\epsilon_{\theta}(\mathbf{h}_{t},t).
\end{equation}

Likelihood score can be approximated by Gaussian approximation, expressed as,

\begin{equation}
p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{h}_{t}) = \int p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{h})p(\mathbf{h}|\mathbf{h}_{t})d\mathbf{h} \approx\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{h}|\mathbf{h}_{t}], \mathbb{V}[\mathbf{h}|\mathbf{h}_{t}])
\end{equation}

Mean and variance of Gaussian distribution is approximated by the Tweedieâ€™s formula~\cite{efronTweediesFormulaSelection2011}.

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{h}_{0}|\mathbf{h}_{t}] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ \bar{\alpha}_{t} }}(1-\sqrt{ 1-\bar{\alpha}_{t} }\epsilon_{\theta}(\mathbf{h}_{t},t)),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{V}[\mathbf{h}_{0}|\mathbf{h}_{t}] = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{t}\nabla_{\mathbf{h}_{t}}^{\top}\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{h}_{0}|\mathbf{h}_{t}],
\end{equation}

Likelihood score can be approximated through Gaussian approximation and Tweedie's formula using well-trained score networks.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& \nabla_{\mathbf{h}_{t}}\log p_{t}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{h}_{t})\\
\approx & (\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{y}} + \mathbf{A}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{t}^{2}\nabla_{\mathbf{h}_{t}}^{\top}\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{h}_{0}|\mathbf{h}_{t}]\mathbf{A}^{\top})^{-1}(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{A}\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{h}_{0}|\mathbf{h}_{t}])
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Due to high complexity of calculation of the inverse matrix, GMRES algorithm is adopted to reduce the complexity~\cite{saadGMRESGeneralizedMinimal1986}.

\begin{equation}
(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{y}}+\mathbf{A}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{t}^{2}\nabla_{\mathbf{h}_{t}}^{\top}\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{h}_{0}|\mathbf{h}_{t}]\mathbf{A}^{\top})\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{y}- \mathbf{A}\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{h}_{0}|\mathbf{h}_{t}],
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{u}$ is ~.
